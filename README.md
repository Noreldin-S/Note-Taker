I connected my github to my heroku, and deployed the files from github repository to heroku repository.
app name called note-taker-c

I created folder assets it will include the css and index.js
inside public index.html and notes.html

for node_modules, i installed express and uuid
I also used nodemon so I dont have to stop the server for each change.
